- Reported hours are rounded (next full 15 minutes) to prevent weird things like 0.12 hours in the report
- Use at your own risk! As this is a quick & dirty job (not even OOP and not using database) there will most likely be some bugs
- Yes, you are allowed to remove my logo. In fact, you may change whatever you like :-)
